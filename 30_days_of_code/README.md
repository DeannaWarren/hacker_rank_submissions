# 30 Days of Code
This Challenge Series started on April 27th 2016.
I have decided to complete the challenges in Python since I am currently learning it and can take notes on things that stand out or are vaguely interesting as I go.

- Day 0: Hello World
  - raw_input() = ruby's gets
- Day 1: Data Types
  - Python is dynamically typed
- Day 2: Operators
  - python variables are in snake_case
  - decimal is a different data type to floats and can be more accurate, must be imported. however floats worked in this case.
- Day 3: ?
